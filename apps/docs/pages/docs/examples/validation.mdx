# Validation

To enable validation, pass your [validator functions](/docs/guides/validator-functions) to `validators` object and map them
to your form _keys_ defined with the `initial` object.

Provide the `onSubmitForm` function which doesn't get called unless all fields passed validation, so this simple setup guards
against invalid requests being sent to your server.

Use the supplied `submit` method to _trigger_ the validation process.
By default, the fields are validated [sequentially](/docs/guides/validation-triggers#on-submit).

Returned `validations` object is used to render validation errors below their respective fields.
