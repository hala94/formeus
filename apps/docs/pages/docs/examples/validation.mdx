# Validation

To enable validation, pass your [validator functions](/docs/guides/validator-functions) to `validators` object and map them
to your form _keys_ defined with the `initial` object.

Provide the `onSubmitForm` function which doesn't get called unless all fields passed validation, so this simple setup guards
against invalid requests being sent to your server.

Returning a Promise in `onSubmitForm` function sets `isSubmitting` value to `true` until promise resolves.

Use the supplied `submit` method to trigger the _validation -> onSubmitForm_ process.
By default, the fields are validated [sequentially](/docs/guides/validation-triggers#on-submit).

`validations` object contains validation information for each of your form fields.
Use `error`, `validating` and `checked` properties to update the UI.
