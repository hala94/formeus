# Validation

To enable validation, pass your [validator functions](/docs/guides/validator-functions) to `validators` object and map them
to your form _keys_ defined with the `initial` object.

Also, as our form now handles validations, we should use the supplied `submit` method and pass the function
that sends the information to server as the `onSubmitForm` argument.

`onSubmitForm` won't get called unless all fields passed validation, so this simple setup guards
against invalid requests being sent to your server.

  _validators_ object expects your form keys mapped to the validator functions.
  Return an *Error* object for failing validations and *undefined* for passing
  validations.
