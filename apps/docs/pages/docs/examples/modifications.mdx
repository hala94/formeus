# Modifications

Each form field has its own `isModified` flag found in the `modifications` object
returned by the _form instance_.

When the form field current `value` is _not equal_ to its value defined in the `initial` property,
the `isModified` flag will be set to `true`.

By default, that _equality_ is determined with _strictly equal_ operator (===) for primitives, and
_deep equality_ for objects.

Value of the `initial` property can change (be updated) during your _form instance lifecycle_, and _Formeus_ will update
`modifications` and report only modified fields in your _onSubmitForm_ function.

Also, by default, _un-modified_ fields will get auto-synced to the latest `initial` values.

<Tabs items={["React", "Solid", "Vue", "Svelte"]}>
  <Tab>
    <ReactModification />
  </Tab>
  <Tab>Coming soon</Tab>
  <Tab>Comming soon</Tab>
  <Tab>Coming soon</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Comparators

If the default behaviour provides unexpected results, or is not performant enough, you can
pass custom `comparators` property which can define a custom comparator functions for every form field.
