# Asynchronous validation

Most common async validation is a network request checking with the backend if the current value is _available_, like username or email, but
it can be anything.

Async validators are _Promises_ that resolve with either an _Error_ object or _undefined_.

Building upon the previous example, we are adding an [async validator](/docs/guides/validator-functions#asynchronous) to our form configuration object.

Also, notice that our _password_ field gets validated with Regex.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  _validators_ always run before _asyncValidators_, preventing unecessary
  requests for something that can be checked on the client. (like an empty
  field).
</Callout>
