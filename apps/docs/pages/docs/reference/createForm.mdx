# createForm

This method creates a new form _instance_ representing the form in your application.

## Options

```js
type FormOptions<TForm extends Record<string, unknown>> = {
  initial: TForm;
  validators?: Validators<TForm>;
  asyncValidators?: AsyncValidators<TForm>;
  onSubmitForm?: (form: TForm) => void;
  config?: FormConfig;
};
```

### `initial`

Required property representing the initial object model for your form.

### `validators`

Object representing validators that run synchronously.

### `asyncValidators`

Object representing validators that run asynchronously.

### `onSubmitForm`

Function that contains your "submit" logic.

Works in conjuction with `submit` method returned from `createForm` and gets
called only if all validations pass.

### `config`

```js
type FormConfig = {
  autoValidate?: boolean,
  validateConcurrentlyOnSubmit?: boolean,
}
```

Configuration options for the current form.

Overrides global config if set.

Read more about the configuration options [here](/docs/reference/setFormConfig).

## Returns

```js
type FormResult<TForm> = {
  values: TForm;
  validations: ValidationResults<TForm>;
  update: <Key extends keyof TForm>(key: Key, value: TForm[Key]) => void;
  runValidation: <Key extends keyof TForm>(key: Key) => void;
  submit: () => void;
  clear: () => void;
  isValid: boolean;
  isValidating: boolean;
};
```

### `values`

Object holding the latest values for your form.

### `validations`

Object that contains `ValidationState` for each form key.

```js
export type ValidationState = {
  validating: boolean,
  error: ValidationResult,
  checked: boolean,
}
```

### `update`

Updates the value for specific key.

### `runValidation`

Manually run validation for given field. Validation results are cached and not repeated until the
value changes.

### `submit`

Method that starts the validation process.

By default, starts sequential validation of your form fields, and stops if some validation fails.

Can be configured to run all validations in parallel.

Calls `onSubmitForm` internally if all validations pass.

### `clear`

Resets form to the initial values.

### `isValid`

**true** if there are no pending or ongoing validations, and all form values are checked and validated.

### `isValidating`

**true** if there are ongoing validations.
