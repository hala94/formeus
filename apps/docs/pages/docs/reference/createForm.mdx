# createForm

This method creates a new form _instance_ representing the form in your application.

## Options

```js
type FormOptions<
  TForm extends Record<string, unknown>,
  TMeta extends Record<string, unknown> = Record<string, unknown>
> = {
  initial: TForm
  validators?: Validators<TForm, TMeta>
  asyncValidators?: AsyncValidators<TForm, TMeta>
  comparators?: Comparators<TForm>
  onSubmitForm?: OnSubmitForm<TForm, TMeta>
  meta?: TMeta
  config?: FormConfig
}
```

### `initial`

Required property representing the initial object model for your form.
This initial values can also be updated during the lifetime of the form instance and is used
to determine form `modifications`.

### `validators`

Object representing validators that run synchronously.
Each field validator is a synchronous function that returns an `Error` instance if validation fails, or `undefined` if validation is successfull.

### `asyncValidators`

Object representing validators that run asynchronously.
Each field async validator is a Promise that either resolves with an `Error` instance if validation fails, or `undefined` if validation is successfull.

### `comparators`

Custom comparator functions for each form field. To determine `modifications`, each fields value must be compared to its previous value.

By default, field _equality_ is determined with _strictly equal_ operator (===) for primitives, and
_deep equality_ for objects, so use this property only if needed.

### `onSubmitForm`

```js
type OnSubmitForm<TForm, TMeta> = (
  form: TForm,
  meta: TMeta,
  modifiedFields: Partial<TForm>
) => Promise<unknown> | void
```

Function that contains your "submit" logic. Gets called with latest form values, any `meta`defined and a special modifications object
that will contain only the form fields which differ from the latest `initial` values.

Works in conjuction with `submit` method returned from `createForm` and gets
called only if all validations pass.

Returning a promise from this function makes returned `isSubmitting` value `true` until promise resolves.

### `config`

```js
type FormConfig = {
  autoValidate?: boolean
  validateConcurrentlyOnSubmit?: boolean
}
```

Configuration options for the current form.

Overrides global config if set.

Read more about the configuration options [here](/docs/reference/setFormConfig).

### `meta`

Optional object that holds additional info which is forwarded to callback functions you
provided - like `onSubmitForm` and validator functions.

Primarily used to resolve a stale closure problem if your callback functions depend on some
surrounding state.

Most likely not needed in libraries like Solid.js.

## Returns

```js
type FormResult<TForm> = {
  values: TForm
  validations: ValidationResults<TForm>
  modifications: ModificationResults<TForm>
  update: <Key extends keyof TForm>(key: Key, value: TForm[Key]) => void
  runValidation: <Key extends keyof TForm>(key: Key) => void
  submit: () => void
  clear: () => void
  isValid: boolean
  isValidating: boolean
  isSubmitting: boolean
  isModified: boolean
}
```

### `values`

Object holding the latest values for your form.

### `validations`

Object that contains `ValidationState` for each form key.

```js
export type ValidationState = {
  validating: boolean,
  error: ValidationResult,
  checked: boolean,
}
```

### `modifications`

Object that contains _modification state_ for each form key.

```js
type ModificationResults<TForm> = Record<
  keyof TForm,
  { isModified: boolean }
>
```

### `update`

Used to update form field values. Function takes a _key_ which represents your specific form field,
and the _new value_ as arguments.

### `runValidation`

Manually run validation for given field. Validation results are cached and not repeated until the
value changes.

### `submit`

Method that starts the validation process.

By default, starts sequential validation of your form fields, and stops if some validation fails.

Can be configured to run all validations in parallel.

Calls `onSubmitForm` internally if all validations pass.

### `clear`

Resets form to the initial values.

### `isValid`

**true** if there are no pending or ongoing validations, and all form values are checked and validated.

### `isValidating`

**true** if there are ongoing validations.

### `isSubmitting`

If your `onSubmitForm` function returns a Promise, the value will be `true`
until Promise resolves.

### `isModified`

If any of your form fields differs from its value defined in the `initial` object, this flag will be set to `true`.
