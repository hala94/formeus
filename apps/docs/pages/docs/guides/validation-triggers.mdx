# Validation triggers

Formeus has three basic validation triggers. This makes it trivial to
achieve common form behaviours but also combine them in different ways.

### Manual

Calling `runValidation` method for the specific field at any point.

For example, you can call it right after updating your field value, or perhaps when
the input field loses focus.

### Automatic

Formeus can be configured to _auto run_ validations on every update.

Use `config` object to control this behaviour on particular _instance_ or use
`setFormConfig` function to control this behaviour globally.

  Validations don't automatically run when _form instance_ is created.
</Callout>

### On Submit

Calling the `submit` method will cancel any running validations and start validation of all of your form fields.

Assuming all validations pass, the supplied `onSubmitForm` function will be called with the latest form values.

`submit` method can be configured to run validations sequentialy or concurrently via the `config` property.
