# Validator functions

Validator functions can either by synchronous or asynchronous.

These functions must resolve with native `Error` instance if the validation should _fail_, or with `undefined`
if the validation should _pass_.

```js
type ValidationResult = Error | undefined
```

### Synchronous

```js
type Validator<
  TForm,
  TMeta extends Record<string, unknown> = Record<string, unknown>
> = (form: TForm, meta: TMeta) => ValidationResult
```

Suitable for quick client side validations like empty fields, or regex statements.

### Asynchronous

```js
type AsyncValidator<
  TForm,
  TMeta extends Record<string, unknown> = Record<string, unknown>
> = (form: TForm, signal: AbortSignal, meta: TMeta) => Promise<ValidationResult>
```

Suitable for any kind of validation that must be resolved with a Promise.

Function is called with the latest form values and the fresh instance of _AbortSignal_ that
can be used to cancel _in flight_ requests.
