# Validator functions

Validator functions can either by synchronous or asynchronous.

These functions must resolve with native `Error` instance if the validation should _fail_, or with `undefined`
if the validation should _pass_.

```js
type ValidationResult = Error | undefined
```

### Synchronous

```js
type Validator<TForm> = (form: TForm) => ValidationResult
```

Suitable for quick client side validations like empty fields, or regex statements.

### Asynchronous

```js
type AsyncValidator<TForm> = (
  form: TForm,
  signal: AbortSignal
) => Promise<ValidationResult>
```

Suitable for any kind of validation that must be resolved with a Promise.

Function is called with the latest form values and the fresh instance of _AbortSignal_ that
can be used to cancel _in flight_ requests.
