# Overview

Formeus is a small, but powerful form state management library.

It deals with both synchronous and asynchronous validations while keeping the exact validation times flexible until submission.

Core is written in pure Typescript with no external dependencies.

## Motivation

When dealing with forms, its often the case that we don't want to include a third party library for seemingly such a simple task, so we roll out
a custom solution.

These solutions usually either cover only a specific case, or don't end up being reusable enough to save time further down the line.

On the other hand, form libraries often do too much or require additional _framework-specific_ components to work, and that is not ideal.

Formeus aims to be a _UI agnostic_ solution that covers most common implementation scenarios and deals with validations in a predictive manner,
so devs can shift their focus to more important parts of the codebase.
