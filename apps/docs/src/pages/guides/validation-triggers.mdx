# Validation triggers

FORM has 3 basic validation triggers. This makes it trivial to
achieve common form behaviours.

### Manual

Calling `runValidation` method for the specific field at any point.

For example, you can call it right after updating your field value, or perhaps when
the input field loses focus.

### Automatic

FORM can be configured to _auto run_ validations on every update.

Use `config` object to control this behaviour on particular _instance_ or use
`setFormConfig` function to control this behaviour globally.

  Setting _config_ on the individual _form instance_ overrides global setting.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Validations don't automatically run when _form instance_ is created.
</Callout>

### On Submit

Calling the `submit` method will cancel any running validations and start sequential validation of all of your form fields.

Assuming all validations pass, the supplied `onSubmitForm` function will be called with the latest form values.

This process will skip already validated fields, but also stop if any of the validations fail.
