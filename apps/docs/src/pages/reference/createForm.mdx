# createForm

This method creates a new form _instance_ representing the form in your application.

## Options

```js
type FormProps<TForm extends Record<string, unknown>> = {
  initial: TForm;
  validators?: Validators<TForm>;
  asyncValidators?: AsyncValidators<TForm>;
  onSubmitForm?: (form: TForm) => void;
  config?: FormConfig;
};
```

`initial`

Required property representing the initial object model for your form.

`validators`

Object representing validators that run synchronously.

`asyncValidators`

Object representing validators that run asynchronously.

`onSubmitForm`

Function that contains your "submit" logic.

Works in conjuction with `submit` method returned from `createForm` and gets
called only if all validations pass.

`config`

```js
type FormConfig = {
  autoValidate: boolean,
};
```

Configuration options for the current form.

Overrides global config if set.

## Returns

```js
type FormResult<TForm> = {
  values: TForm;
  validations: ValidationResults<TForm>;
  update: <Key extends keyof TForm>(key: Key, value: TForm[Key]) => void;
  runValidation: <Key extends keyof TForm>(key: Key) => void;
  submit: () => void;
  clear: () => void;
  isValid: boolean;
  isValidating: boolean;
};
```

`values`

Object holding the latest values for your form.

`validations`

Object that contains `ValidationState` for each form key.

```js
export type ValidationState = {
  validating: boolean,
  error: ValidationResult,
  checked: boolean,
};
```

`update`

Updates the value for specific key.

`runValidation`

Manually run validation for given field. Validation results are cached and not repeated until the
value changes.

`submit`

Method that starts the validation process.

Validation process is executed sequentally in order defined by the object keys of the `initial` argument.
Calls `onSubmitForm` internally if all validations pass.

`isValid`

**true** if there are no pending or ongoing validations, and all form values are checked and validated.

`isValidating`

**true** if there are ongoing validations.
