# Overview

Formeous is a small, but powerful form state management library.

It deals with both synchronous and asynchronous validations while keeping the exact validation times flexible until submission.

## Motivation

When dealing with forms, its often the case that we don't want to include a third party library for seemingly such a simple task, so we roll out
a custom solution.

These solutions usually either cover only a specific case, or don't end up being reusable enough to save time further down the line.



Formeus aims to be a _UI agnostic_ solution that covers most common implementation scenarios and deals with validations in a predictive manner,
so devs can shift their focus to more important parts of the codebase.

{/*
But soon enough, there is a requirement to have some input server-side validated before submission and the custom solution doesn't support it, so you
add the functionality.

Great, now there are extra fields that also need validation, but they have to be validated on the client before server, so you either continue with
upgrading the solution, or pick a library.

Core is written in pure Typescript so it can easily be ported to
various frameworks like React, Solid, Vue and others.
