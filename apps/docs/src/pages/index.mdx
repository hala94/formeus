# Overview

Form is a headless library for handling form input and validation.
Core is written in pure Typescript making it library agnostic, so it can easily be ported to
various libraries like React, Svelte, Vue and others.

## Motivation

Handling form input and validation is a verbose task that often ends up with too much boilerplate code usually repeated
all over the codebase.

Custom implementations often tend to be project specific, and usually don't handle validations in a predictive and unified way.

Form aims to be a UI agnostic go-to solution that can covers most common implementation scenarios and deals with both client-side
and server-side validations in a predictive manner, so developers can shift their focus to more important parts of the codebase.

## How it works

In the most basic configuration, Form is a simple state holder. It can "hide" away the boilerplate code and provide latest
values.

Advanced configuration with both client and server validators is where it really shines.
Form will handle validation task serialization and "protect" your server from invalid
requests, all while exposing the internal validation state that can be used to update the UI.
