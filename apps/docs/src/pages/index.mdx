# Overview

FORM is a headless library for handling form input and validation.
Core is written in pure Typescript so it can easily be ported to
various frameworks like React, Solid, Vue and others.

## Motivation

Handling form input and validation is a verbose task that often ends up with too much boilerplate code repeated
in multiple places.

FORM aims to be a _UI agnostic_ solution that covers most common implementation scenarios and deals with both synchronous
and asynchronous validations in a predictive manner, so devs can shift their focus to more important parts of the codebase.
