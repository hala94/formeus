# createForm

This method creates a new "form instance" representing the actual form in your application.

## Arguments

createForm method will accept the object typed below. The object is a generic type that is generic over
the actual form values you will use in your UI.

The only required key is "initial" which is used to construct internal objects and provide minimal basic form functionality.

```js
type FormProps<TForm> = {
  initial: TForm,
  clientValidators?: ClientValidators<TForm>,
  serverValidators?: ServerValidators<TForm>,
  onSubmitForm?: (form: TForm) => void,
  config?: FormConfig,
};
```

#### initial

#### clientValidators

#### serverValidators

#### onSubmitForm

#### config

## Returns

```js
type FormResult<TForm> = {
  form: TForm;
  validations: ValidationResults<TForm>;
  update: <Key extends keyof TForm>(key: Key, value: TForm[Key]) => void;
  runValidation: <Key extends keyof TForm>(key: Key) => void;
  submit: () => void;
  isValid: boolean;
};
```

#### form

Represents the latest form state.

#### validations

Each form field will have its own validation object attached to it.
The object will contain validation status information that can be used in your presentation layer.

#### update

Call this method to update the form value for specific key.

#### runValidation

Manually run validation for given field. All validation results are cached and not repeated until the
value changes.

#### submit

Use this method to "protect" your server from un-validated or invalid input.
Calling this method starts both client and server side validations for every form field, and
calls "onSubmitForm" if all fields pass validation.

#### isValid

Will be true only if there are no pending or in-flight validations. Used for presentation purposes.
